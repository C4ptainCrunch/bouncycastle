{"name":"Bouncy Castle","tagline":"Simple youtube to mp3 converter based on Cherrypy and Youtube-dl","body":"#Bouncy Castle\r\n\r\nBouncy castle is a self-hosted converter to convert Youtube videos (or Soundcloud musics) to mp3.\r\nIt's like [youtube-mp3.org](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/) but on **your** machine (and also, it does not block some videos like [youtube-mp3](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/)).\r\n\r\nIt is a simple web front-end to the CLI `youyube-dl` python converter.\r\n\r\n## I wanna screenshot !\r\n![Home page](http://pics.urlab.be/albums/divers/bouncy_home.png)\r\n\r\n## Roll your own !\r\nBouncy Castle is super easy, try it at home !\r\nIt has only few dependencies : `python2.7+` and `youyube-dl` (witch uses `ffmpeg`)\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\tgit clone git://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/bouncycastle.git\r\n\tvirtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages ve \r\n\tsource ve/bin/activate\r\n\tpip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\t\r\nCheck `config.py` for an example configuration file and put the values you want to overwrite in `production.py`\r\n\r\n### Run\r\nYou should run `web.py` for the web interface and `convert.py` to convert the videos. (I use supervisord to run both)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nBouncy Castle is AGPLv3+ licensed and heavily uses [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) which is in the Public Domain.  Bouncy also uses [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/ a lot (BSD licence).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
